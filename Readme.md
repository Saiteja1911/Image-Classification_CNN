**README: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for CIFAR Image Classification**

**Overview:**
This repository contains code for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow's Keras Sequential API to classify images from the CIFAR10 dataset. The CNN architecture consists of convolutional and pooling layers followed by dense layers for classification.

**Files:**
1. **cifar10_cnn.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the code for loading the CIFAR10 dataset, defining and training the CNN model, and evaluating its performance.
2. **README.md:** This file, providing an overview of the project, instructions, and key information.

**Dependencies:**
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (v2.x)
- Matplotlib

**Instructions:**
1. Open `cifar10_cnn.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment or Google Colab.
2. Execute the code cells sequentially to load the dataset, define the CNN model, and train the model.
3. The notebook includes visualizations and summaries to help understand the model architecture and training progress.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using the provided test set.

**Dataset:**
The CIFAR10 dataset consists of 60,000 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Classes include 'airplane,' 'automobile,' 'bird,' 'cat,' 'deer,' 'dog,' 'frog,' 'horse,' 'ship,' and 'truck.'

**Model Architecture:**
- Input Shape: (32, 32, 3) for CIFAR images (width, height, color channels).
- Convolutional Base: Three Conv2D layers with MaxPooling2D layers for feature extraction.
- Dense Layers: Flattening layer followed by two Dense layers for classification.

**Training:**
- Model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, SparseCategoricalCrossentropy loss, and accuracy metric.
- EarlyStopping callback is implemented to prevent overfitting.
- The model is trained for 10 epochs on the training set.

**Evaluation:**
- Test accuracy is plotted against training accuracy to visualize model performance.
- The final test accuracy is printed.

**Results:**
The trained CNN achieves a test accuracy of over 70%, demonstrating effective image classification on the CIFAR10 dataset.

Feel free to explore and modify the code for experimentation and further learning. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the TensorFlow documentation or raise an issue in this repository."# Image-Classification_CNN"
